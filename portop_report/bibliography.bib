abstract = {The traditional estimated return for the Markowitz mean-variance optimization has been demonstrated to seriously depart from its theoretic optimal return. We prove that this phenomenon is natural and the estimated optimal return is always  times larger than its theoretic counterpart, where  with y as the ratio of the dimension to sample size. Thereafter, we develop new bootstrap-corrected estimations for the optimal return and its asset allocation and prove that these bootstrap-corrected estimates are proportionally consistent with their theoretic counterparts. Our theoretical results are further confirmed by our simulations, which show that the essence of the portfolio analysis problem could be adequately captured by our proposed approach. This greatly enhances the practical uses of the Markowitz mean-variance optimization procedure.},

abstract = "A factor analysis-based approach for estimating high dimensional covariance matrix is proposed and is applied to solve the mean–variance portfolio optimization problem in finance. The consistency of the proposed estimator is established by imposing a factor model structure with a relative weak assumption on the relationship between the dimension and the sample size. Numerical results indicate that the proposed estimator outperforms the plug-in, linear shrinkage and bootstrap-corrected approaches."
