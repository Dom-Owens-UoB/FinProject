## Factor Analysis

Within this project, we will use **Factor Analysis** as a dimension reduction technique for our mutlivariate time series $\mathbf{x}_t$. The problem is treated as follows:

We wish to reduce the dimension of an observable random vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbbm{R}^p$ to a smaller vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbbm{R}^m$ of latent variabes, where $m << p$.

We do this by expressing each $x_i$ as a linear combination of the factors: 
$$x_i = \lambda_{i1} f_1 + ... + \lambda_{im} f_m + \epsilon_i \hspace{30pt} \mathbf{x} = \Lambda \mathbf{f} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$$ 

Here, $\Lambda$ are the **factor loadings**, and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ are errors.

We make the following assumptions:

- $E(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}) = \boldsymbol{0}$, $E(\boldsymbol{f}) = \boldsymbol{0}$, $E(\boldsymbol{x}) = \boldsymbol{0}$ (WLOG)

- $E(\boldsymbol{\epsilon \epsilon^T}) = \boldsymbol{\Psi}$ is a diagonal matrix

- $E(\boldsymbol{f f^T}) = \boldsymbol{I}_m$, so that the factors are independent

- For inferential purposes, we make distributional assumptions on $\boldsymbol{f}$ or $\boldsymbol{x}$ (often multivariate normality)

### Estimation

As opposed to the similar-looking regression problem $ \boldsymbol{y} = X \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon} $, in which the desgin matrix $X$ is known, we know neither $\boldsymbol{f}$ nor ${\Lambda}$; hence, any "best-fit" solutions will not be unique.
